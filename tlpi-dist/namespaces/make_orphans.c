/* Supplementary program for Chapter Z */

/* make_orphans.c

   Copyright 2022, Michael Kerrisk

   Demonstrate that when a child process becomes orphaned because its parent
   terminates, the child is reparented, and hence its parent PID changes.

   Classically, the orphaned child is reparented to PID 1, but on a system
   that runs Systemd as the init process, the child may instead be reparented
   to a "child subreaper" process that has a PID other than 1.

   See https://lwn.net/Articles/532748/. This program is a more flexible
   version of the orhan.c program described in that article: it permits the
   creation of multiple orphans that sleep for a specified period before
   terminating.

   Usage: make_orphans [num-orphans [orphan-sleep-secs]]
                        Default: 1     Default: 120
